# TADSGames
A collection of TADS3 games, in subdirectories, as I learn this system/language/platform

Each subdirectory has a classic Makefile used to drive the compilation and test-run process. (Lo! My C/C++ roots reassert themselves!) Top-level Makefile builds them all, just for grins and giggles.

These are all built to use the [FrobTADS](http://tads.org/frobtads/frobtads-1.2.3.dmg)(on macOS) system.

## MyGame
The first game from the "Getting Start in TADS 3" manual.

## OrbOfSatisfaction
This is the game described in the [QuickStart](https://www.tads.org/t3doc/doc/t3QuickStart.htm). Split
into three directories for version 1, version 2, and version 3, respectively. Makefile there will build v1, v2, or v3 into the output directory, overwriting whatever other versions were built.
